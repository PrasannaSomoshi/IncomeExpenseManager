# IncomeExpenseManager

This is a web application built using Django. <br>
Users can register themselves with sign up & log in with proper authentication. <br>
Users can manage and keep track of their Incomes and Expenses <br>
I have used Django's ModelForms & UserCreationForm. <br>
For authentication I have used validation methods provided by Django such as authenticate(), login() & logout().
